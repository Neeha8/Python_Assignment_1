    "## 1) Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reusability:** Functions allow you to write reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of program. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Modularity:** Functions enable you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Each function can be responsible for a specific task or operation, making code easier to understand and debug. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability:** Functions improve the readability of code by providing meaningful names to blocks of code that perform specific actions. Instead of having a long sequence of instructions, we can encapsulate related functionality within a function and give it a descriptive name. This makes code more self-explanatory and easier for other developers to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintainability:** Functions contribute to the maintainability of code by promoting code reuse and modularity. When we need to make changes or fix issues, we can focus on a specific function without affecting the rest of the program. This simplifies the debugging and testing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code organization:** Functions help in organizing your code into logical units, making it easier to navigate and manage. We can group related functions together, create separate files for different modules, or even organize functions within classes or namespaces. This structuring improves the overall structure of your program and enhances collaboration among team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code testing:** Functions facilitate unit testing, which involves testing individual components of our code. By breaking down your program into smaller functions, we can write test cases for each function and verify its correctness independently. This makes it easier to identify and fix issues, ensuring the reliability and quality of code."

    "## 5) How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Scopes:** Global scopes are the scopes that exist at the top level of a Python program or module. When we define variables, functions, or classes outside of any function or class definition, they belong to the global scope. The global scope is accessible throughout the entire program. In a Python program, there is typically one global scope per module or script. However, if you import modules from other files, each module will have its own global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Scopes:** Local scopes are created whenever a function is called or when a block of code, such as a loop or conditional statement, is executed. Each function call or block of code creates a new local scope. Variables defined within a local scope are only accessible within that specific scope and its nested scopes. When a function or block of code completes its execution, the local scope is destroyed. This means that local variables are typically temporary and only exist for the duration of the function call or block execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the number of global scopes in a Python program depends on the number of modules and scripts used, while the number of local scopes depends on the number of function calls and block executions within the program."

    "## 7) What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**return value** refers to the value that a function produces and returns to the caller when the function is executed. When a function reaches a return statement, it immediately exits and returns the specified value (if any) back to the caller.\n",
